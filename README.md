This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled errors in asynchronous operations causing the server to crash.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling using try...catch blocks and a centralized error handler.
